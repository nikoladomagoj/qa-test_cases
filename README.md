## 🧪 QA Methodologies Used

Across all documents, the following testing practices were applied:

### ✔ Functional testing  
Ensuring each feature behaves as intended.

### ✔ UI validation  
Confirming that error messages, buttons, and layout behave correctly.

### ✔ User flow testing  
Checking full journeys, such as:
- user logs in
- user creates an account
- user submits a form

### ✔ Edge case testing  
Testing less common but important scenarios  
(e.g., autofill login, new device login, custom gender selection).

### ✔ Smoke testing  
Quick checks verifying that essential features work after deployment.

### ✔ Exploratory testing  
Free investigation of an application to discover unexpected behaviour.

### ✔ Structured test documentation  
Each test case includes:
- ID  
- Summary  
- Preconditions  
- Detailed steps  
- Expected result  
- Actual result  
- Status
